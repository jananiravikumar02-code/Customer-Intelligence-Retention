# Customer Intelligence Dashboard – ML-Based Segmentation & Retention

Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end customer analytics system built using e-commerce data. It combines data analysis, machine learning, and Power BI visualization to understand customer behavior, segment users, and identify returning vs at-risk customers.

Dataset
- Records: 17,000+ transactions
- Files used:
  - ecommerce_data.xlsx
  - customer_powerbi_data.xlsx

Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Machine Learning (K-Means, Classification Models)
- Power BI (Interactive Dashboard)
- Jupyter Notebook

Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Customer-level feature engineering:
   - Total spend
   - Total orders
   - Session duration
   - Engagement metrics
3. Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering
4. Classification modeling to predict:
   - Returning customers
   - At-risk customers
5. Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score
6. Visualization of insights using Power BI

Key Insights
- Not all customers behave the same — segmentation reveals distinct behavior groups
- Returning customers show higher engagement and spending
- ML models help identify at-risk customers early
- Business insights are more impactful when combined with dashboards
